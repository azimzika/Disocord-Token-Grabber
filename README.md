# Disocord-Token-Grabber

A Discord token grabber written in Python 3.

This version of the grabber only supports Windows.

Features
No local caching
Transfers via Discord webhook
Searches for authorization tokens in multiple directories (Discord, Discord PTB, Discord Canary, Google chrome, Opera, Brave and Yandex)
No external Python modules required
[todo] Cross-platform support

How to use
Create a webhook on your Discord server. I recommend creating a new server.
Change the 'WEBHOOK_URL' variable value to your Discord webhook URL in token-grabber.py
(obfuscate the code or install it as a backdoor in an other script.)
Send the script to your victim and make them run it.
